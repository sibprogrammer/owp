1. Requirements
---

The following software is required to be installed on server with panel:
* Ruby 1.8.6+
* RubyGems
* Ruby SQLite3 support

The following software is required to be installed on physical server, which 
will be used for OpenVZ containers:
* OpenVZ kernel
* OpenVZ tools (vzctl, vzlist)
* Ruby 1.8.6+


2. Installation of the build
---

Place build archive to the server where you plan to run the panel. Move 
build archive content to destination directory, e.g. /opt/ovz-web-panel/.
This can be achived using the following command:
tar -xzvf ovz-web-panel-X.X.tgz -C /opt/

Panel is written on Ruby. So you need to have it to run the panel. Please check
the Ruby version:
ruby -v
If you haven't ruby installed jet it's time to install it. For example on Ubuntu
using apt:
apt-get install ruby rubygems libsqlite3-ruby

To start the panel run the command:
sudo ruby /opt/ovz-web-panel/script/server -e production -d

To shutdown application the following command can be used (be careful):
sudo kill -9 `pidof ruby`

Then need to place hardware daemon on the server with OpenVZ. There are two
possible scenarios: panel is installed on hardware node or panel is on separate
server. Physical server daemon located at <install-root>/utils/hw-daemon/ 
Copy content of directory to OpenVZ physical server. Then copy 
hw-daemon.ini.sample to hw-daemon.ini. Next step is to generate unique key, 
which will be used for authorization between panel and daemon. Key can be 
generated using the  following command for example:
head -c 200 /dev/urandom | md5sum
Key should be placed to hw-daemon.ini as a value of "key" parameter. Now daemon
can be  started by the command: "sudo ruby hw-daemon.rb start". Daemon should
work  under root user to be able to manipulate with containers.

To start the daemon run:
sudo ruby hw-daemon.rb start

Daemon can be stopped using the following command
sudo ruby hw-daemon.rb stop


3. Installation from SVN repository
---

Source code can be checked out anonymously via:
svn checkout http://ovz-web-panel.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ owp

File http://code.google.com/p/ovz-web-panel/source/browse/trunk/build/build.sh
contains information on how to prepare working copy.

Daemon expects that vz partition located at /vz. On Ubuntu it's need to create
symlink:
ln -s /var/lib/vz /vz
